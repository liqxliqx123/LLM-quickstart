I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

Perhaps the weather gods have something against us.\\n\\nOnce inside, we found a warm atmosphere - though if it's cold outside, you won't want to sit too close to the door.  TR says the other side can get warmer because it's close to the kitchen, and we might have wanted to do that because every time the door opened it sent in a new shivery blast.  It may not matter at different times of year, but this one caused me to want to put my coat back on more than once.\\n\\nThe tables come with a nice helping of bread, complete with butter and marinara, which was good, but because the marinara is served cold, it didn't help.  Piping hot marinara would have been nice.\\n\\nWe started ordering like we hadn't eaten in forever.  Perhaps we hadn't - but the poor server (Melissa?) could hardly keep up.  First a pizza.  Then some pasta.  Some salmon cakes.  Beef spiedies.  It's really amazing that it all came out at about the same time, and that was just the appetizers, not to mention the drinks that kept flowing the whole time!\\n\\nAfter they were ordered (one at a time, no less - not all at once), we ordered some entrees, and at least we acted like we had been at a restaurant before, getting the order in all in at the same time.  Of course, when those were delivered, we started trading food like we either didn't like what we ordered or were a bunch of old biddies who couldn't make up our minds what we wanted.\\n\\nStill, a good time was had by all (except perhaps the staff).\\n\\nAll in all, we had four of the pizzas, a couple of pasta dishes, the beef spiedies and the salmon cakes.  I don't think I missed anything.  For pics, check out the main Zio review.  Since there wasn't anything especially made for us, I added them there so people could check them out.\\n\\nGlad to see Bill F., Dave S., Denise E., Julia S. and of course TR P. at the UYE.  Whoever said size mattered?  This crew made for a fine event.  Thanks for organizing it, TR!</td>\n",

If they're that busy, you would think they could hire someone to answer the phone in the evening hours. I even went as far as calling Barringtons, one of the \\\"sister\\\" restaurants and had no luck there either.

The waitress asked what kind of fries we'd like, regular or sweet potato. My three companions went with the sweet potato fries, and I picked regular but asked for a veggie patty instead of meat. \\n\\nWhen it came time for the bill, I noticed my bill came to about $2 more than I was expecting - as it turned out, they charged me $1.50 to sub in a veggie patty. Being the cheapskate I am (hey, at least I admit it), I mentioned that it was lame for them to charge me $1.50 extra when their veggie burger was the same price as their beef and turkey burgers. My three friends looked at their bills, and realized they'd been charged $1.50 for \\\"subbing\\\" sweet potato fries. \\n\\nThere hadn't been any notes on the menu that there'd be charges, so we brought it up to the waitress when she came to get the bill. Her response was \\\"My bad, it was totally my job to tell you. Sorry!\\\" -- but she didn't offer to take off the charge or, if she wasn't authorized to do so, talk to a manager. \\n\\nPoor customer service equaled poor tip - we knocked $6 ($1.50 x 4 people) off what we would have left her. I feel kind of bad for doing it, but at the same time the menu should advise of extra charges and/or the server shouldn't ask if you want something that costs extra without telling you.\\n\\nThe unfortunate part is that the food was actually really good - I got the Tex-Mex burger with a black bean patty (good texture on the patty, tasty salsa/avocado, and a surprisingly spicy and delicious sauce). My friends ordered the turkey berry, salmon, and crab cake burgers, which they all enjoyed. Despite the tastiness, I probably won't go back - there are plenty of places I can get a good veggie burger without having to spend $12 on it. \\n\\n2.5 stars, a solid 4 if going on food alone.</td>\n",
